Notes on implementation details, in no specific order:

The program will only support using one profile/account/file at a time.
It is made to be a simple, quick and easy way to track your money and view your transaction history.
I use the term "Profile" to denote a single person's finances.
Transactions are not separated by account type (cash, credit, etc...). All transactions belong to one large
list. Type is/will be distinguished by an attribute in the transaction data structure.
I don't know how to program well, don't judge me.
